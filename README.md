# MAC Spoofer

## Introduction
Commands can be easy to forget. If you're doing wireless pentesting sometimes it is useful to change your MAC address on the fly. This tool allows you to do that. Please do not use this tool for nefarious purposes. 

## Requirements
* Python3

## Installation / Use
Fetch it
```
git clone https://github.com/bsmith14843/QuickMacChanger
```
To Run
```
python3 MacSpoofer.py
```
## Future Goals
Not too many. Proved out my goals on this. May tweak bugs here and there. Remember, I'm not a programmer :)
